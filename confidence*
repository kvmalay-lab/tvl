In the History page, the Confidence column represents the Average Pose Detection Confidence for that specific workout session.

It indicates how well the AI (MediaPipe) was able to track your body landmarks (joints) throughout the workout.

High Confidence (Green / >80%): The camera had a clear, unobstructed view of your body, and the tracking was accurate.
Medium/Low Confidence: Might indicate poor lighting, part of your body was out of frame, or the angle was difficult for the AI to interpret.
This metric helps you gauge the reliability of the rep count and form tracking for that session.
